1. To run the new GSAT and WalkSAT algorithms, right click on SAT.py and press run. This should create a new cnf file that
can be run within Sudoku.py.
2. Go into Sudoku.py, and at the bottom replace the existing file with your new solution file from SAT.py. Run the program

-For SAT.py to run correctly, you must first create an SAT object that takes the cnf.file you want to work in. Creating a list
of variables with sat.creat_cnf_list and setting it equal to a variable will give a the parsed cnf.file. This variable can be
used as a parameter in sat.GSAT or sat.WalkSAT. GSAT takes that list, a max-tries number, and max_flips. WalkSAT takes those
three paramters, as well as one more that is the probability value between 0 and 1. I have set it to 0.3, as per my professor's
suggesion.
